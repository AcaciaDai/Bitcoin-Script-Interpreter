# The Evolution of Bitcoin Script Interpreter
Acacia Dai

This final project for Cryptocurrency Cabal with David Evans will explore the evoluton of the Bitcoin Script Interpreter. The Interpreter is the part of the Bitcoin core that defines the various Script opcodes used in locking and unlocking scripts. The opcodes have changed over time, sometimes with minor modifications and sometimes to fix major vulnerabilities. 

I will be looking at how these opcodes have changed over time, as well as the process by which they were changed. Bitcoin has no central authority in charge of fixing problems in its code. Thus, it could be difficult to fix a problem without revealing the vulnerability to potential attackers, especially now that there are so many more Bitcoin users and Bitcoin is much more valuable than in its early days.
